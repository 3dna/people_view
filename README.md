===============================

Installation
-------------
### Prerequisites:
* [git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
* [bundler](http://gembundler.com/)

### Steps:
1. In order to use this sample application, clone the repository and cd to it:

  ```
    git clone https://github.com/3dna/people_view
    cd people_view
  ```

2. Once inside, you must install the project's dependencies with bundler:

  ```
    bundle install
  ```

3. Once the bundling process completes, you need to provide database credentials in config/database.yml

  ```
    cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml
    # edit database.yml to match your configuration.  The example file is sufficient to start
  ```

4. Migrate the database you set up:

  ```
    bundle exec rake db:migrate db:test:prepare
  ```

5. Run the server:

  ```
    bundle exec script/rails server
  ```

Now you should be able to use the application, just navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default
