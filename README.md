Installation
-------------
# Prerequisites:
* git
* ruby
* bundler

# Steps:
* In order to use this sample application, clone the repository and cd to it:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/3dna/people_view
  cd people_view
```

* Once inside, you must install the project's dependencies with bundler:

```bash
  bundle install
```

* Once the bundling process completes, you need to provide database credentials in config/database.yml

```bash
  cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml
  # edit database.yml to match your configuration.  The example file is sufficient to start
```

* Migrate the database you set up:

```bash
  bundle exec rake db:migrate db:test:prepare
```

* Run the server:

```bash
  bundle exec script/rails server
```

* Now you should be able to use the application, just navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default
